Anim-2.0 Particle Renderer


Nick:

if you're on ubuntu you'll need to install these packages:
    libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev libxi-dev libxrandr-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev

otherwise, if you're on manjaro than all you need is premake!

I'd recommend taking a look in /Examples for what is working so far. 
Theres a crash when you close out the program that I am aware of and will hopefully fix tommorrow :)


to run the example, go into the Examples directory in terminal and type:

./ExProject | ./Anim2
